# Simple-Verlet-Engine
This is a simple verlat integration based physics engine made with python and pygame

As of now you can run cloth and rigid body simulations with or without collisions

In the Scripts/settings file you can change some functionality by changing the values of the variables

After you run the main.py program you can interact with the engine in these ways:
- left_shift + left_click to add objects
- right_click + drag to add rigid objects
- right_click + left_shift + drag to add cloth


Use the X or escape button to exit the program
